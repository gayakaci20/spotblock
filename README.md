## 🔧 Installation  

### Prerequisites
- **macOS**: No additional requirements
- **Windows**: Install [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

### Steps
1️⃣ **Clone the repository** 📂  
2️⃣ **Make the script executable**:  
   ```bash
   chmod +x spotblock.sh
   ```

## 🚀 Usage  

### On macOS:
```bash
# Block Spotify ads 🚫
sudo ./spotblock.sh block  

# Restore the original hosts file 🔄
sudo ./spotblock.sh restore  

# Check status 🔍
sudo ./spotblock.sh status  

# Clear Spotify cache 🧹
sudo ./spotblock.sh clear-cache
```

### On Windows:
1. Right-click on Git Bash and select "Run as administrator"
2. Navigate to the script directory
3. Run the same commands as above (without sudo):
```bash
# Block Spotify ads 🚫
./spotblock.sh block  

# Restore the original hosts file 🔄
./spotblock.sh restore  

# Check status 🔍
./spotblock.sh status  

# Clear Spotify cache 🧹
./spotblock.sh clear-cache
```

## ⚙️ How It Works  

🛠️ **SpotBlock** modifies the system's hosts file:
- **macOS**: `/etc/hosts`
- **Windows**: `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`

🚫 This prevents ads from loading while you enjoy your music.  

## 🔴 Important Notes  

✅ **Automatic backup** 🗂️: The script **creates a backup** of the `hosts` file before making any changes.  
✅ **Restart required** 🔄: After blocking ads, **Spotify must be restarted** for the changes to take effect.  
✅ **Cache clearing** 🧹: If ads persist, try clearing the cache with the `clear-cache` command.  
✅ **Updates needed** 🔄: Spotify may change its ad domains, so periodic **updates** to the blocklist may be required.  

## ⚠️ Disclaimer  

📢 **This script is provided for educational purposes only.** Modifying system files may have unintended consequences. **Use at your own risk.**  
📡 **Spotify may update its system to bypass this method,** so effectiveness may vary over time.
